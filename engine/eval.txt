- bare kings are draw
- single minor piece (without pawns) cannot win, alone, against pawns or against another minor piece (there are mating positions, but they require cooperation, and can be avoided by search; the same applies to well-known checkmate executed by lone knight against edge pawn)
- two knights against bare king cannot win
- rook against a minor piece is difficult to win, return something like score / 2 or score /4
- rook and a minor piece against rook is hard to win, return something like score / 2 or score / 4 


End-games that need scaling when white seems ahead:

KBxKBy (unlike Bishops, x and y any number of Pawns with x - y <= 2), divide by 2

* No mating potential (B, N, NN): dead draw. (Possible exception requiring detailed analysis or EGT: KNNKP.)
* Any of the above with 1 Pawn extra for white, and a minor or Rook extra for black (e.g. KNNPKR*, KBPKN*). Divide by 4.
* No Pawns, minor or less ahead in piece material, (i.e. extra minor, exchange ahead, two minors vs Rook ahead, equal), weak side not more than 3 minors, 2 Rooks or 1 Queen. E.g. KQBKQ*, KQBKRR*, KRRNKRR*, KRRKRN*, KRKN*, KBBKR*, KBBNKBN* (* = 0 or more Pawns). Divide by 8. (Possible exception: KBBKN*, divide by 2 or 4.)
* Any of the above with 1 Pawn extra for white, and a minor extra for black (e.g. KRPKBN). Divide by 2.
* More piece material or larger advantage without Pawns, against non-bare King (e.g. KRRKBB*): divide by 2.
